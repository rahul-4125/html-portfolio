<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Rahul K, an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems and designing efficient software solutions. Currently pursuing a B.E. in Computer Science Engineering at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology (graduating January 2026), I specialize in both frontend and backend development and have hands-on experience building innovative projects.</p>

<p>I’ve developed a Wearable Mobility Assistance System to aid visually impaired individuals, leveraging Arduino Nano and IDE.</p>

<p>My expertise includes object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. I enjoy collaborating with teams, offering technical guidance, and delivering impactful results in every project I take on.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I contribute as a member of the UAV Drobotics club at my college, where innovation meets teamwork. My goal is to combine my technical skills and passion for problem-solving to create meaningful software that makes a difference.</p>

<p>Let’s connect and build something great together!</p>
